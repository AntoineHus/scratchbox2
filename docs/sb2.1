very volatile, the best documentation is in the source of sb2.
.IP SBOX_TARGET_ROOT
Target location. If not defined, .sb2rc file is searched for.

.SH CONFIGURATION
To configure sb2, do something like this:

mkdir $HOME/buildroot
cd $HOME/buildroot
[fetch a rootfs from somewhere and extract it here]
sb2-init /path/to/cross-compiler/bin/arm-linux-gcc

Put this in your $HOME/.sb2rc to make sb2 default to using $HOME/buildroot:
SBOX_TARGET_ROOT=~/buildroot
