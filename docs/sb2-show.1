.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sb2-show [\-b binary_name ] [\-m mode ] [\-f function ] [\-D ] [\-v ] command_tag [parameters] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sb2-show
command must be run from inside scratchbox2. The sb2-show provides
developer valuable information about pathmappings that the sb2
pathmapping engine is executing during runtime. This diagnostics tool
helps you understand what files are used and from what location when using
the sb2 development environment.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-v
verbose. Give lots of output.
.TP
\-b binary_name
This option outputs the mapping modifications that are related to the binary name ie program name that you specify with this option.
.TP
\-m mode
Show using named mapping sb2 mode (default=current sb2 mode)
.TP
\-f function
This option can be used when you are debugging mapping rules in sb2. The function name is the full name of library or system call that you want to monitor.
.TP
\-D
Ignore directories while verifying path lists

.SH COMMAND TAGS
.TP
path [path1] [path2] [pathN]
Show mappings of pathnames
.TP
exec file [argv0] [argv1] [argvN] 
Show execve() modifications done by sb2
.TP
log-error 'message' 
Add an error message to logfile
.TP
log-warning 'message' 
Add a warning message to the logfile
.TP
verify-pathlist-mappings required-fix [ignorelist] 
Read list of paths from stdina and check that all paths will be mapped to required 'prefix/n'


.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
$ sb2 sb2-show path /etc
/etc => /opt/maemo/dists/etch/etc (readonly)

This shows where the /etc directory gets mapped under your active sb2
target.  In this example the /etc gets mapped to
/opt/maemo/dists/etch/etc directory in your host.  The /etc directory
has been defined to be readonly.

$ sb2 sb2-show path /home/yourname
/home/yourname => /home/yourname

This example shows where your own home directory gets mapped. By
default under sb2 environment your home directory is the one you use
as your real home directory. Your home directory is read-write.

$ sb2 sb2-show exec /bin/ls
File    /bin/ls
Mapped  /opt/maemo/dists/etch/bin/ls (readonly)
argv[0] /bin/ls

This command shows what execve() modifications are done by sb2 engine
to the binary that is being executed. It also shows you the argument
vector.  In the above example you can see that in maemo mode (ie build
mode) the /bin/ls program is actually executed from location
/opt/maemo/dists/etch/bin/ls in your linux pc.
