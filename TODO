* libtool: kdrive x server fails to build because of libtool (???)

* apt/dpkg build dependency checks for host and target need to be dealt
  appropriately. Currently full checks are done against both, which is not
  necessarily correct.

* Cleanup lua_scripts/argvenvp.lua, there's duplicate code in it at the
  moment. Naming should be changed to indicate it's really about
  controlling execve.

* hashbang detection should probably be moved later in the exec-pipeline,
  and maybe the pipeline should be travelled twice, first for the script, then
  for the interpreter? Currently it's all done in one pass which makes it
  relatively convoluted.
