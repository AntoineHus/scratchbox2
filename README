This is development code, it is broken. Don't expect to use it for
anything resembling production use any time soon.

Here are some instructions:

You need git to work with sbox2, get it from http://git.or.cz/.



Build using:

$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install prefix=$HOME/buildroot

At this point you should setup debian/sarge in $HOME/buildroot/scratchbox/sarge
Use debootstrap to get the job done. After completing that step you can do:

$ cd $HOME/buildroot
$ mkdir proc
$ ./login.sh


Clean using:

$ make clean



To test the libsb2.so without a chroot:

$ export SBOX_REDIR_SCRIPTS=$(PWD)/redir_scripts
$ LD_PRELOAD=$(PWD)/preload/libsb2.so /bin/csh


Some additional environment variables:

$ export SBOX_TOOLS_ROOT=/scratchbox/yourdistro
$ export REDIR_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SBOX_TOOLS_ROOT/usr/lib:$SBOX_TOOLS_ROOT/lib:$SBOX_TOOLS_ROOT/usr/local/lib
$ export REDIR_LD_SO=$SBOX_TOOLS_ROOT/lib/ld-linux.so.2



that's all folks, enjoy!
