This is development code, it is broken. Don't expect to use it for
anything resembling production use. However, I firmly believe this is
infinitely more functional than Scratchbox 1.x can ever be.

Here are some instructions:

You need git to work with sbox2, get it from http://git.or.cz/.



Build using:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install prefix=$HOME/scratchbox


Fire it up:

$ mkdir $HOME/buildroot
$ cp $HOME/scratchbox/share/scratchbox2/sb2.config.sample \
$HOME/buildroot/sb2.config

(at this point you _really_ should go through that file and make sure
it applies to your host system and intended target toolchain)

$ cd $HOME/buildroot
$ ../scratchbox/bin/sb2



That's all folks, enjoy!
